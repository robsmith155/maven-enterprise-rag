    "# RAG-Enhanced Question Answering for SEC-10K Filings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement and test a question-answering system that leverages our optimized RAG retrieval pipeline from the previous analysis. Building on our comprehensive evaluation of retrieval strategies, we now focus on the end-to-end performance of the system in answering specific financial questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous evaluation demonstrated that a combination of hybrid search (with metadata filtering) and reranking produces the most effective retrieval results. This approach successfully addresses the challenge of maintaining global context (such as company names and reporting periods) that is often lost during standard chunking and embedding processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question-answering system we develop here follows a straightforward but powerful approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Process a user query\n",
    "2. Retrieve the most relevant document chunks using our optimized pipeline\n",
    "3. Inject these chunks into a carefully crafted prompt\n",
    "4. Generate an answer using a large language model (LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll test this system against our benchmarking dataset of financial questions, which provides a realistic evaluation of the system's capabilities in extracting and synthesizing information from SEC filing reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this initial implementation, we'll focus on qualitative evaluation through manual inspection of the generated answers. This allows us to gain insights into the system's strengths and weaknesses before developing more formal evaluation metrics. While future work will incorporate automated evaluation, it's worth noting that the retrieval component—which we've already rigorously evaluated—represents the critical foundation of the system. Without effective retrieval of relevant context, even the most sophisticated LLM would be unable to provide accurate answers to specific financial questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up our question-answering pipeline and examining its performance on real-world financial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites**: You need to have run the previous three notebooks before this one. Also make sure that you've added your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import the required libraries and define the best pipeline configuration to use."

The primary drivers behind this change were:<br><br>1. **Decrease in iPhone Sales**: The most significant factor contributing to the decline in net sales was the decrease in iPhone sales. The lower iPhone unit sales were a major contributor to the overall reduction in net sales [1], [3].<br><br>2. **Increase in Other Product Categories**: This decrease was partially offset by increases in other areas. There was a rise in net sales of Wearables, Home and Accessories, driven primarily by higher sales of AirPods and Apple Watch [2], [3]. Additionally, the Services segment saw an increase, primarily due to higher net sales from the App Store, licensing, and AppleCare [2].<br><br>3. **Currency Fluctuations**: The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significant unfavorable impact on net sales in 2019. This currency effect negatively influenced net sales across various geographic segments including Europe, Greater China, and the Rest of Asia Pacific [1], [5].<br><br>4. **Geographic Performance Variations**: While there were increases in some geographic areas, these were not enough to offset the decreases in others. For instance, net sales in Greater China and Japan decreased primarily due to lower iPhone sales, despite increases in Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories sales [5].<br><br>These factors combined led to the overall decrease in Apple's net sales from 2018 to 2019.<br><br>References:<br>[1] Document: AAPL 2019 SEC Filing (ID: AAPL_2019), Chunk ID: 46ac772e-cb47-421b-a2a8-fbed8ac0d919<br>[2] Document: AAPL 2019 SEC Filing (ID: AAPL_2019), Chunk ID: a9881923-2fa7-4fee-83f3-e99774105303<br>[3] Document: AAPL 2019 SEC Filing (ID: AAPL_2019), Chunk ID: c65319f4-ef25-4692-96b0-7d4474907d19<br>[5] Document: AAPL 2019 SEC Filing (ID: AAPL_2019), Chunk ID: c09d9f31-cf4b-4f72-bdfe-be525c663f45\n",

       "                        NVIDIA's revenue growth from 2016 to 2021 showed a significant increase. In 2016, NVIDIA's revenue was $5.01 billion, marking a 7% growth from the previous year [1]. By 2021, the revenue had surged to $16.68 billion, representing a 53% increase from the previous year [4].<br><br>The main drivers behind these revenue changes include:<br><br>1. **GPU Revenue Growth**: In 2016, the GPU revenue increased by 9% primarily due to growth in GeForce GPUs for gaming and Tesla products for data centers [1]. By 2021, the growth in the Graphics segment was 29%, driven by GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs [3].<br><br>2. **Data Center Expansion**: A significant boost in 2021 revenue came from the Data Center segment, which saw a 124% increase. This growth was fueled by the Mellanox acquisition and the ramp-up of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture [2].<br><br>3. **Acquisitions and New Technologies**: The acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 significantly contributed to the revenue in 2021, with Mellanox revenue accounting for 10% of the total company revenue [2]. The introduction of new GPU architectures and expansion into new product areas also played crucial roles.<br><br>4. **Diverse Segment Performance**: While some segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization saw declines due to specific market conditions such as COVID-19 impacts and shifts in product demand, others like OEM and Other revenue grew by 25% in 2021, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs [2].<br><br>Overall, NVIDIA's strategic acquisitions, expansion into new markets, and continuous innovation in GPU technologies were key factors driving the substantial revenue growth from 2016 to 2021.<br><br>References:<br>[1] NVDA 2016 SEC Filing (ID: NVDA_2016)<br>[2] NVDA 2021 SEC Filing (ID: NVDA_2021)<br>[3] NVDA 2021 SEC Filing (ID: NVDA_2021)<br>[4] NVDA 2021 SEC Filing (ID: NVDA_2021)\n",
